      <title>Plugin Networks (Research)</title>
      <link>http://neuralspike.ai/project/plugin_net/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 30 Mar 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      <guid>http://neuralspike.ai/project/plugin_net/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;We introduced the Plugin Networks, an innovation enhancing model flexibility. These auxiliary networks, attached to original models, enable the alteration of model behavior without the necessity of retraining the foundational structure. While our focus was predominantly on discriminative models, the versatile application also extends to generative models, showcasing its broad utility.
We used a simialr idea in our Image Generation project.&lt;/p&gt;
